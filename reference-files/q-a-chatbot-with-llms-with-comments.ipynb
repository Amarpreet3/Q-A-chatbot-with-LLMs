A Death Eater  moved\n\n“Now!” barked Moody.\nWith all of their eyes upon him, Harry reached up to the top of his head,\ngrabbed a hank of hair, and pulled.\n“Good,” said Moody, limpi ng forward as he pulled the stopper out of the\nflask of potion. “Straight in here, if you please. ”\nHarry dropped the hair into the mudlike liquid. The moment it made\ncontact with its surface, the potion began to froth and smoke, then, all at\nonce, it turne d a clear, bright gold.\n“Ooh, you look much  tastier than Crabbe and Goyle, Harry, ” said Her-\nmione, before catching sight of Ron ’s raised eyebrows, blushing slightly,\nand saying, “Oh, you know what I mean – Goyle’s potion looked like\nbogies.”\n“Right then, fake Potters line up over here, please, ” said Moody.\n\nThere   was     a       sudden  rummaging       for     quills  and     parchment.      Over    the     noise,\nSnape   said,   “And    a       point   will    be      taken   from    Gryffindor      House   for     your    cheek,\nPotter.”\n                                                Things  didn’t  improve for     the     Gryffindors     as      the     Potions lesson\ncontinued.      Snape   put     them    all     into    pairs   and     set     them    to      mixing  up      a       simple\npotion  to      cure    boils.  He      swept   around  in      his     long    black   cloak,  watching        them\nweigh   dried   nettles and     crush   snake   fangs,  criticizing     almost  everyone        except\nMalfoy, whom    he      seemed  to      like.   He      was     just    telling everyone        to      look    at      the\nperfect way     Malfoy  had     stewed  his     horned  slugs   when    clouds  of      acid    green\nsmoke   and     a       loud    hissing filled  the     dungeon.        Neville had     somehow managed to\nmelt    Seamus’s        cauldron        into    a       twisted blob,   and     their   potion  was     seeping across\n\nHedwig.\nHagrid\n\nHarry   borrowed        Ron’s   quill,  scribbled       Yes,    please, see     you     later   on      the     back\nof      the     note,   and     sent    Hedwig  off     again.\n                                                It      was     lucky   that    Harry   had     tea     with    Hagrid  to      look    forward to,     because\nthe     Potions lesson  turned  out     to      be      the     worst   thing   that    had     happened        to      him     so\nfar.\n                                                At      the     start-of-term   banquet,        Harry   had     gotten  the     idea    that    Professor\nSnape   disliked        him.    By      the     end     of      the     first   Potions lesson, he      knew    he’d    been\nwrong.  Snape   didn’t  dislike Harry   —       he      hated   him.\n                                                Potions lessons took    place   down    in      one     of      the     dungeons.       It      was     colder\nhere    than    up      in      the     main    castle, and     would   have    been    quite   creepy  enough\nwithout the     pickled animals floating        in      glass   jars    all     around  the     walls.\n\nQuestion: Give me 5 examples of cool potions and explain what they do\nAnswer: Sure! Here are five examples of cool potions from the story:\n\n1. Polyjuice Potion: This potion allows the drinker to take on the appearance of someone else. In the story, Hermione suggests using this potion to create decoys for themselves during a dangerous mission.\n2. Memory Potion: This\n\nSources: \nharry-potter-sorcerers-stone - page: 50 \nharry-potter-sorcerers-stone - page: 59 \nharry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-j.k.-rowling - page: 589 \nharry-potter-and-the-deathly-hallows-j.k.-rowling - page: 47 \nharry-potter-sorcerers-stone - page: 99 \nharry-potter-sorcerers-stone - page: 98\n\nTime elapsed: 13 s\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Gradio Chat UI\n\n- **<font color='orange'>At the moment this part only works on Google Colab.
